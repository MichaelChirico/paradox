\itemize{
\item \code{param}            :: \link{Param}
Quick access to the one param in the set.

\section{Currently implenented samplers}{

\itemize{
\item \code{Sampler1DDblUnif$new(param)} \cr
Uniform random for (bounded) doubles.
\item \code{Sampler1DIntUnif$new(param)} \cr
Uniform random for (bounded) integer.
\item \code{Sampler1DFct$new(param, prob = NULL)} \cr
Categorical distribution, for a fct or lgl param.
\code{prob} is a numeric vector of \code{nlevels} probabilities, which is uniform by default.
\item \code{Sampler1DDblNorm$new(param)} \cr
Normal sampling (truncated) for doubles.
Has member variables \code{mean} and 'sd' which you can change to influence sampling,
they are initialized to \code{mean=mean(range)} and \code{sd=span/4}.
\item \code{Sampler1DRfun(param, rfun, trunc = TRUE)} \cr
Arbitrary sampling from 1D rng functions from R.
Pass e.g. rfun=rexp to sample from exponential distribution.
\code{trunc = TRUE} enables naive rejection sampling, so we stay inside of [lower, upper].
\item \code{new_sampler_1d_unif(param)} \cr
Creates an approriate 1D uniform sampler from above for an arbitrary param.
